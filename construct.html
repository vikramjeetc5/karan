 This Ministry is primarily responsible for development and maintenance of 
 National Highways (NHs).The Ministry keeps on receiving proposals from various
 State Governments/Union Territories (UTs) for declaration of State roads as new 
 National Highways (NHs). The Ministry considers declaration of some 
 State roads as new NHs from time to time based on requirement of connectivity,
 inter-se priority and availability of funds.The declaration of State roads as
 new NHs are considered based on well established principles; the criteria for
 State roads for declaration as new NHs include roads running through length 
 / breadth of the country, connecting adjacent countries, National Capitals 
 with State Capitals / mutually the State Capitals, major ports, non-major 
 ports, large industrial centers or tourist centers, roads meeting
 very important strategic requirement in hilly and isolated area, arterial
 roads which enable sizeable reduction in travel distance and achieve substantial
 economic growth thereby, roads which help opening up large tracts of
 backward area and hilly regions (other than strategically important ones)
 achieving a National Highways grid of 100 km, etc.

   To construct an irrigation project whether it is a dam or weir
   or barrage, first and foremost observation should be the 
   presence of water and its availability. The availability 
   may be of different types, but proper examination is required
   before construction .If there is any river flowing in that 
   area, we should know the type of river whether it is perennial
   or inundation type. If it is perennial, then the water is 
   available throughout the year. If it is Inundation River, 
   then study its previous yearly discharges.
   The river should meet the requirement of water in that area.
   Suitable site be available to construct an irrigation project.
   After investigating the water availability, topography map of 
   the area is studied. This study is more useful when marking
   the tentative alignment for irrigation project. The behavior
   of agricultural lands are examined in this stage.
   When plenty of water or major source of water is available
   then the location to construct an irrigation project is 
   selected.

 A flyover is a high-level road bridge that crosses over another 
 railroad or highway intersection or an existing road. It is also
 called an "overpass." In order to prevent traffic congestion 
 below, flyovers are constructed to allow for safe passage over
 obstacles. A road, highway, or railroad may be required for the
 passage.A bridge and a flyover differ from one another depending
 on how they will be used and where they will be constructed
 Bridges are constructed to link two separate locations; these
 locations may be found naturally in places like valleys,
 rivers, seas, or other water bodies. Whereas a flyover is 
 constructed to connect two points in congested areas, such 
 as roads and highway intersections.This particular flyover 
 is the one that is used the most often. This type of highway 
 is used for fast-moving traffic to cross railway lines or 
 heavy vehicular junctions.Cloverleaf flyover is a form of 
 grade separator as well.
